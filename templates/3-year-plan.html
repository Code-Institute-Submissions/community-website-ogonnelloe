    <p>The home page is a 'less is more' case and not sure if we list what's on the page as we will have those tabs sitting atop the page. I would say a basic welcome and invitation to enjoy
What we should consider, I recommend, is an "About' page where we can do a mix of demographics/more detail on the community but also some deserved showboating of the community. We could also host a video on the community there (presuming I can convince our digital team to allow us do that FOC).
I also recommend that we have a 'Gallery' tab/page for a selection of images from the parish. It's the beauty of the place that initially draws people here so let's five it to them and it's probably the easiest page we create. Not a historical one but some really good images that Mike Mc would mostly have but also others might be able to throw into the mix. Shots that show off the beauty of the parish - for those visitors, potential dwellers to enjoy. And we could add in some that reflect the culture of spirit of community that exists here - the better shots from events. We could put a shout out to people to submit images for inclusion as well, which would raise awareness of what is coming by way of the website - the communication committee communicating!
